# IPX:Dynamic IP-Backed Bond Protocol


A decentralized protocol that lets creators, studios, or IP owners **mint bond-like tokens** representing future cashflows from their intellectual property (IP) such as:

* YouTube Ad revenue
* Spotify streams
* Substack subscriptions
* GitHub Sponsors
* Kindle eBooks
* Game revenue

These tokens can be sold to backers, investors, or fans effectively **raising capital against future performance**.

> Think of it as “Kickstarter meets DeFi Bonds for Creators”, but decentralized, automated, and governed by DAO.

## Problem Statement: IPX – On-Chain Financing for Digital Revenue Streams

Modern digital creators generate substantial recurring revenue across platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Substack, but **lack direct access to decentralized capital markets**. While the revenue data is available through public APIs, there’s currently no protocol that can:

* **Trustlessly collateralize creator earnings**
* **Tokenize and fractionalize IP revenue streams as financial NFTs**
* **Programmatically route revenue through smart contract waterfalls**
* **Enable real-time payouts and investor liquidity — all fully on-chain**

At the same time, DeFi lacks high-quality, real-yield collateral sources beyond stablecoins and governance tokens. This creates an untapped opportunity for structured, yield-generating products backed by **provable, off-chain cashflows**.

> **IPX solves this by bridging off-chain creator revenues into on-chain structured finance instruments**, using HTTPS outcalls, Service Nervous System (SNS) DAOs, and revenue-distributing canisters on ICP.

We leverage:

*  **HTTPS outcalls** to fetch verified creator earnings (e.g., YouTube/Spotify analytics)
*  **Canister logic** to escrow and waterfall-distribute revenue
*  **ICRC-7 NFTs** to represent investor shares in each IP revenue stream
*  **SNS DAOs** to govern creator projects and approve early redemptions or buyouts
*  **End-to-end decentralization** enabled by Internet Computer’s boundaryless compute model
